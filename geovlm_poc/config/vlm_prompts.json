Separate observation from interpretation.\nSplit your description into three levels:\n1) Object-level: what is inside each bbox.\n2) Local context: what is immediately around each object.\n3) Tile-level environment: overall scene, terrain, activity traces.\nIf uncertain, explicitly use \"uncertain\" in the relevant fields.\n{size_note}\nYOLO tile class counts:\n{class_counts}\nDetections (det_id mapping, do not change bbox):\n{detections}\nReturn ONLY JSON matching schema:\n{schema}\n"
